## Tutorial Scene

### Features
The Tutorial Scene provides an essential introduction to the game's mechanics for new players. It is accessible via a designated button within the main menu and is constructed as a separate scene. The tutorial is composed of three sequences, each made to sequentially tell and inform the user of the game's functionality. Progression through these sequences is handled by a Tutorial Script, which mandates the completion of set conditions, such as specific player interactions, to proceed. This script ensures that the tutorial's interactive components are not merely demonstrative but require active engagement. A Dialogue Script manages the display of instructional text. The script ensures timely and contextually relevant information is presented, facilitating an understanding of each step before the player advances. The visual elements of the tutorial, including the dialogue box and pointer arrows, use externally sourced images, enhancing the visual guidance for players. Furthermore, animations within the tutorial are powered by the Dotween animation package, providing smooth transitions and movements that highlight interactive elements and contribute to an intuitive user experience.
