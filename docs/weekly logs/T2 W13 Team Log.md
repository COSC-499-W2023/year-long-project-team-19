OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p> So we were focused on finishing up the last of the features we need to have done for the final report submission this week, as well as the shared list of system features and finishing up our 
README for said final submission report and video. Not a lot of time for anything else. Got the Tutorial and game over scenes working last minute and maybe a couple of tweaks to the card abilities, as well
as card art for most of the cards on the website.
