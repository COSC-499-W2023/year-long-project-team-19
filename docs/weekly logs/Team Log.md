OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>The burnup chart looks incomplete because we didn't have a project made until the last minute. It won't look like that in future. We used JUnit for testing, so our output doesn't have fancy output like the example, so we weren't sure what to screenshot. Also, we included what the older manual test's output looks like as a bonus.</p>
