OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>We didn't do any coding this week, since we were more concerned with finishing the project plan document and building our Teck Stack. This means there was nothing to write tests for, so there is no screenshot above. We did settle on a version of Unity that comes with some tutorials that we have started working through on our own, but they don't feel relevant to write tests for (and we would need serveral screenshots if we all did it ourselves, which would be the best way to actually use the tutorials, and several branches since we wouldn't be collaborating on them). </p>
