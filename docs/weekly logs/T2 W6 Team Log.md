<br><p>This week Henry fixed the bug he found during the week, and worked on adding a "add rule" and "edit rule" to the admin site. Brenner had to get the server to deal the correct cards from the gameDeck to
each player working properly, and it proved to be a bit more complex than expected. Right now one of the players (the host) will see the correct cards in the right places on their screen while the other will 
see the correct cards still, they just aren't in the right place yet. Aditya started work on a zoom in function to hopefully make the cards a bit easier to read if the player hovers over them. Adrian 
experimented with changing the UI of the cards to make the cards more readable, as well as changing some of the abilities of the cards and the attack system to try some different balancing. Leo continued work
on the reset password feature and continued polishing the login & create account features. there is a link to our other repo below that contains the full project (the version we used from peer testing #1 is
the branch we linked below)</p>
