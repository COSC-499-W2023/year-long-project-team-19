OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>So this week we started the presentation slides and started putting the finishing touches on the features that will be in our game's demo. The UI menus got flushed out further, and the card shuffling system is more detailed etc. We didn't actually "finish" the slides or our demo's tasks in the project board because our presentation isn't until Thursday, so we are still going to put some finishings touches on it yet. We have a separate repo set up that we successfully can all access and import each other's projects from, found at the link below.</p>
