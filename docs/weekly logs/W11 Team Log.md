OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>So this week was reading week, so not much has changed since W10. We further flushed out the login system, as well as the card game itself and the website. Trying to just get some features finished enough for the design document and video milestone due in W13.
We still have the mini presentation demo project in a seperate Github repo found at the link below, but we now are uploading the game scripts and scenes to the main repo so that our commits will 
show up on this repo as well.</p>
