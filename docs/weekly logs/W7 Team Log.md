OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>We still don't have any assingments/documentation to do this week (apart from the logs), so we just did more tutorials as part of our
exploration into Unity, and tried to get Unity set up with GitHub on everyone's computers. We now have a separate repo set up that we successfully can all access and import each other's projects from, found at the link below. We have a UI set up, and we can run our games in local web browser. Also, we have a draft of our card shuffling system built.</p>
