<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p>For this week's project plan I did a lot of research and development for the game itself. I helped write out sections of the project plan. I also finalized the rules and potential interactions/mechanics for the game itself.</p>

<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p>This week was all about exploration. I explored the basics of Unity and learnt how to use stage and the game. I also learnt how to work with assets, I also made a mock version of our game. It's unfinished but in good progress, at about the same pace as I expected. I also learnt about scripting and scriptable objects using C#. </p>

<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p>This week was another week for exploration. This time I started to explore more on the game mechanics side of development. I developed a way to create a deck of cards and shuffle it. I've also managed to work on the more visual aspects of Unity related to UI. </p>

<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p> This week our team focused a lot more on the presentation. On top of that we were mostly working to fix bugs and develop the demo so it would be functional for the demo. I also worked on learning Unity's built in testing feature. </p>
