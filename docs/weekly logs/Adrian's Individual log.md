<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p>For this week's project plan I did a lot of research and development for the game itself. I helped write out sections of the project plan. I also finalized the rules and potential interactions/mechanics for the game itself.</p>


<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>

<ol>
  <li>"Figure out the Tech Stack"</li>
  <li>"Project Plan Document"</li>
  <li>"Set up Unity"</li>
  <li>"Demo game for Unity</li>
  <li>"Individual Logs" </li>
</ol>

<h2> Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week? </h2>

<h3>Completed: </h3> 
  <p>Brenner and I finished the tech stack. We decided on several things to implement and did research on the viability (implementation-wise and cost-wise). I also finished setting up and testing Unity.</p>  
<h3>In Progress:</h3>
<p> Began developing a very shallow prototype of the game to try out and for discovery purposes. </p>
