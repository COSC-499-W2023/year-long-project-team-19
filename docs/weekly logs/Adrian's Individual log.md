<p>This week was all about exploration. I explored the basics of Unity and learnt how to use stage and the game. I also learnt how to work with assets, I also made a mock version of our game. It's unfinished but in good progress, at about the same pace as I expected. I also learnt about scripting and scriptable objects using C#. </p>

<p>This week I created the scripts for the turns players will take. I also opted to create the resource system. In development we're just referring to it as "mana" but plans change. Other than that I also designed several UI options on paper for how cards will appear. I tried restructuring our prefabs for the cards to imitate one of the designs, it's currently still a work in progress. This time around, testing was offloaded to Aditya, we'll see how effective this new system will work out.</p>

<h2>Progress: </h2>

<p>This was the aforementioned restructuring for card prefabs and the turn based system being implemented. Also seen on the bottom right, is the resource system. Overall decent progress but more should come in the following week.</p>
<img src = "https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-19/blob/development/docs/weekly%20logs/log_imgs/designCardSample.jpeg"/>
<p>These are some of the designs I'm going to pitch to the team. There are several options for how we're going to design our cards so players will have an easy time identifying certain features. </p>
<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>
<ol>
  <li>"Unity Turn System": This is the turn system for players and opponents. Each turn players gain one resource and after playing out their turn, they can end their turn. Ending a turn begins the other players turn.</li>
  <li>"Unity match related UI": This week I worked on the cards UI elements. Trying to designate changes to certain elements to make it look aethetically nicer and from a UX perspective make it easier to look at.</li>
  <li>"Exploration: Adrian" & "Unity drag and play": This week and for the week after I will look at resources to help me learn how to drag objects and how objects can interact with one another. Currently watching <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGr-7GZJNXg">this</a> video as one of my resources.</li>

<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p>The past two weeks I was working on two main things. I was supposed to do the drag and drop and I was supposed to work with Aditya to finish testing. I decided to swap out drag and drop for next week in favor of making a health bar as testing proved to take up more time than expected. So this week I finished making the health bar and all associated scripts. I also helped Aditya with some Unity Play Mode Tests. I only helped him initially and left him to finish the testing.</p>

<h2>Progress: </h2>
<img src = "https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-19/blob/gameDevelopment/docs/weekly%20logs/log_imgs/Adrian_2023-10-01_healthImg.png"/>

<p>This is the game object I made that uses a several images and a text object to create the overall healthbar. The script written takes in the maximum health points and current health points as floats and generates a fill amount based on those two variables.</p>

<p>
  This week I worked on matching the resource system to the cards. This means cards can only be played if they are equal to or less than the players resource. The second feature, is the attacking feature. This is my biggest feature for this coding session. It's finished but there are still a few bugs that are preventing us from shipping it into the main branch. Right now the changes are in GameDev branch.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>

  This week we focused a lot more on bug fixing in preparation for the heuristics evaluation. For my portion I added the cards to the website and helped bugfix the login system for local use. Furthermore, after the heuristic evaluation recommmendations I added some of the recommendations.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>

</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>

  This week I did bug fixing, streamlining features, and workshopping new features.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>
<ol>
  <lI>
"Game Scaling Issue": For a while our game had a scaling issue where it would scale up when we built and ran it. I fixed this issue by working on the scene and changing several options. Mainly it was figuring out the fit to size toggles. 
  </lI>
<li>
"UI Recommendations: Glowing rings and arrows": After discussing with Brenner we both agreed that the arrow that shows players where to attack should only appear after players played a card. I added this change. I also added a few in game reminders to tell players what can and cant be played.
</li>
<li>
"Action points workshopping": During our team meeting we discussed the possibility of adding an action point system to limit players to certain game actions per turn. I thought this was a good idea and workshopped this potential design direction. I workshopped this change and is now a pending change, the plan is to merge it into the game development branch once everyone was on board with this design change.  At the end of the day its a prototype or proof of concept, we will see if this feature will be cut.
</li>
</ol>
<h2> Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week? </h2>

<h3>Completed: </h3> 
<p>All the changes made this week on my end were completed. Its just a matter of discussing whether or not the changes will be viable in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<h3>In Progress:</h3>
<p>For the break and the week after there were talks of working on card design and how we're going to implement sprites for the cards. We're also moving towards shifting things to work with the server. I'm also thinking of reworking some cards to fit into our scope, we did realize some of the game parts seemed a little too difficult and scope creep did seem to play a part there.</p>

<p>
  This week I worked on the card abilities. I implemented a framework for this function and figured out how to draw cards as an ability. This was one of our bigger issues as calling a static function from a different class caused a lot of issues. Starting the coroutine on another class also opened up a whole other can of worms but I solved this through update triggers in the deck script.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>
<ol>
  <lI>
"Programming Card Abiliities": After assigning the abilities to the cards it was obvious that some of them needs a bit more work than the others. So this week I made progress on the abilities and now I'm working through most of them slowly. 
  </lI>

</ol>
<h2> Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week? </h2>

<h3>Completed and In Progress: </h3> 
<p>Because of the high amount of cards we have and the redesign on some of the abilities we I'm not quite done yet and this feels like a multi-week task. But having figured out the bulk of the issues I can start working on this more efficiently.</p>

<p>
  This week I had to work on the card zoom feature in preparation of our heuristic evaluation. I was supposed to work more on the abilities but had to divert more attention towards fixing and finalizing another feature that was supposed be finished before the evaluation. So for the sake of the evaluation I had to focus on that feature for now.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>
<ol>
  <lI>
"Card Zoom on Hover Feature": After reviewing the progress made by Aditya for this feature I had to make a lot of adjustments to make this feature work. It was a lot more prefab and script changes than expected and took longer than I had hoped. This meant I had less time to work on abilities.  
  </lI>

</ol>
<h2> Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week? </h2>

<h3>Completed and In Progress: </h3> 
<p>While the card zoom on hover feature is technically finished I think it could do with more refining. After the heuristic evaluation the group sort of came to an agreement that this feature isn't as polished as we had hoped. The text was still a more blurry than we had hoped. So we are working to fix that. This will be included in next week's tasks. </p>

<p>
This week I finished up on the abilities script. I managed to finish all of the doable abilities. I wrote the scripts for all the colors. Some Abilities are left blank on purpose until we finalize the ability and finalize multiplayer so we can enable targetting.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>

This week I worked on mostly UI fixes considering how broken the UI. Most of the text was either blurry  or impossible to read. Furthermore, there were bugs in some features that I had to work on mainly the zoom feature. I also polished the game further by making assets and adding UI elements into the game. We also met to discuss documentation.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>

<p>I have a general mock up of the game's UI direction we're finalizing. The text for most prefabs have been fixed so they're not presented as blurry anymore. Furthermore, the zoom feautre had more bugs that I had to fix, some cards were displayed even when they weren't supposed to and some cards would be displayed a little too far up. But those bugs were fixed.</p>
