<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p>This week was all about exploration. I explored the basics of Unity and learnt how to use stage and the game. I also learnt how to work with assets, I also made a mock version of our game. It's unfinished but in good progress, at about the same pace as I expected. I also learnt about scripting and scriptable objects using C#. </p>

<p>This week was another week for exploration. This time I started to explore more on the game mechanics side of development. I developed a way to create a deck of cards and shuffle it. I've also managed to work on the more visual aspects of Unity related to UI. </p>

<p>This week I created the scripts for the turns players will take. I also opted to create the resource system. In development we're just referring to it as "mana" but plans change. Other than that I also designed several UI options on paper for how cards will appear. I tried restructuring our prefabs for the cards to imitate one of the designs, it's currently still a work in progress. This time around, testing was offloaded to Aditya, we'll see how effective this new system will work out.</p>

<h2>Progress: </h2>

<p>This was the aforementioned restructuring for card prefabs and the turn based system being implemented. Also seen on the bottom right, is the resource system. Overall decent progress but more should come in the following week.</p>
<img src = "https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-19/blob/development/docs/weekly%20logs/log_imgs/designCardSample.jpeg"/>
<p>These are some of the designs I'm going to pitch to the team. There are several options for how we're going to design our cards so players will have an easy time identifying certain features. </p>
<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>
<ol>
  <li>"Unity Turn System": This is the turn system for players and opponents. Each turn players gain one resource and after playing out their turn, they can end their turn. Ending a turn begins the other players turn.</li>
  <li>"Unity match related UI": This week I worked on the cards UI elements. Trying to designate changes to certain elements to make it look aethetically nicer and from a UX perspective make it easier to look at.</li>
  <li>"Exploration: Adrian" & "Unity drag and play": This week and for the week after I will look at resources to help me learn how to drag objects and how objects can interact with one another. Currently watching <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGr-7GZJNXg">this</a> video as one of my resources.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Completed: </h3> 
  <p>"Unity Turn System" has been completed but only the backend portion of it. The frontend portion is still a WIP.</p>
  
<h3>In Progress:</h3>
<p>Card designs will be pitched next meeting and in the next cycle I'll work on our UI and the drag and drop feature. Still learning drag and drop using the aforementioned link.</p>

<h2>Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?</h2>

<p>The past two weeks I was working on two main things. I was supposed to do the drag and drop and I was supposed to work with Aditya to finish testing. I decided to swap out drag and drop for next week in favor of making a health bar as testing proved to take up more time than expected. So this week I finished making the health bar and all associated scripts. I also helped Aditya with some Unity Play Mode Tests. I only helped him initially and left him to finish the testing.</p>

<h2>Progress: </h2>
<img src = "https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-19/blob/gameDevelopment/docs/weekly%20logs/log_imgs/Adrian_2023-10-01_healthImg.png"/>

<p>This is the game object I made that uses a several images and a text object to create the overall healthbar. The script written takes in the maximum health points and current health points as floats and generates a fill amount based on those two variables.</p>
<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>

  <p>Unity Health Points are done. I also reviewed a bit of code, running other people's code on my system making sure things work fine.</p>
  
<h3>In Progress:</h3>
<p>This week I'm going back to the drag and drop portion of our game and if I have time I will work on a system where cards can affect players health points.</p>

<p>This week we were just doing more design, planning, and set up more than development. We solidified new meeting times and discussed the projects requirements further. This week I created the card design documents. I designed the cards and decided on the themes of the game with Brenner. </p>

<p>
  This week I worked on matching the resource system to the cards. This means cards can only be played if they are equal to or less than the players resource. The second feature, is the attacking feature. This is my biggest feature for this coding session. It's finished but there are still a few bugs that are preventing us from shipping it into the main branch. Right now the changes are in GameDev branch.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>
<ol>
  <lI>Attack feature: This week I added targetting for the cards. The cards can now target enemies and have their health reduced.</lI>
  <li>Match Cost of Cards: Cards are now only playable if you have enough resources.</li>
</ol>
<h2> Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week? </h2>

<p>Matching the cost of cards are fully completed. </p> 

<h3>In Progress:</h3>
<p>There is a bug where cards played are treated as they aren't and this prevents cards from attacking players so that is a bug we need to fix. Next week we're trying to fix bugs that prevent the live build from working and testing the game.</p>

  This week we focused a lot more on bug fixing in preparation for the heuristics evaluation. For my portion I added the cards to the website and helped bugfix the login system for local use. Furthermore, after the heuristic evaluation recommmendations I added some of the recommendations.
</p>

<h2> Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features? </h2>
<ol>
  <lI>
"UI Recommendations: Glowing rings and arrows": The recommendation was to add a glowing effect to distinguish what objects are interactable and arrows to show where cards should go. I scripted and added the game objects to our current build.
