OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p> This week we were focused on finishing up the last features and any small bugs/last minute changes, as well as figuring out what needs to be done before the final report is due in one week. Henry 
continued setting up tests for the website using Selenium, and generated card art for each card in the game (but its only on the website right now, not in game yet). Brenner got the attack feature to work 
over multiplayer, and got the server to handle the the player's health and mana values as well, so now two clients can actually attack each other and pay for the cost of playing cards. they also fixed a bug
where players could click the end turn button and deal themselves a new card every single time regardless of if it was their turn or not, now they are only dealt the card when they end their own turn properly.
Adrian continued work on implementing different card abilities, and is almost completely finished now. They also ironed out some bugs with the game's UI on the multiplayer branch (card zoom and missing 
elements). Leo created our "game over" scene that will be triggered once a player's health equals 0. It still needs to update the user's stats if they are logged in when they play. Aditya is almost finished 
the tutorial game scene, and it looks very solid so far. Since its the last week before our final submission now, our focus is going to be on that final report and video this week.

Our other Repo that contains the Unity project itself is below; (It is the most up to date multiplayer branch)</p>
