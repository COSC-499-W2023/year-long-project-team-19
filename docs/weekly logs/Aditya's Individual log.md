Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone? 

During these two weeks, I explored more in Unity and expanded my knowledge on the software itself. I looked up several tutorials to provide me an intial understanding of how to construct a 2D card game. I replicated a sample game to test out the features we will implement in the actual game design. Following the tutorials I now know how to create a basic card object, different types of cards, a deck of cards. I am still in the process to learn the shuffle, draw and turn features but that will be completed very soon. I was not able to focus more on this proejct this week as I also had a midterm for a different class.

As a group, we still have to decide our theme for the game and divide the work for the presentation as well. We also have to collectively build the demo and confirm if all the features work accordingly. We completed the landing page and efatures for the game such as different cards, generating a deck from those cards, and how to shuffle the deck before distributing the cards. We also have started working on our mini presentation.
