## Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

During these two weeks, I explored more in Unity and expanded my knowledge on the software itself. I looked up several tutorials to provide me an intial understanding of how to construct a 2D card game. I replicated a sample game to test out the features we will implement in the actual game design. Following the tutorials I now know how to create a basic card object, different types of cards, a deck of cards. I am still in the process to learn the shuffle, draw and turn features but that will be completed very soon. I was not able to focus more on this proejct this week as I also had a midterm for a different class.
