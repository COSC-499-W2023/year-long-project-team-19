OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p> This week we were focused on getting our final build ready for peer test #2. We needed to get the card zoom working and the password reset function into the final build by Tuesday, in order to have time 
to get it built and running on two machines for the class on Thursday. Aditya and Brenner got some progress done on the card zoom, but it wasn't until Adrian picked it up on Tuesday that it was working well 
enough to be tested. Henry continued polishing the "add rule" and "edit rule" features on the admin site. Leo did manage to finish up the password reset feature by Tuesday as well, but its merge actually broke
our whole branch that we were going to use for the final build. Adrian was able to salvage his features to a separate branch after reverting a commit, but Leo's Unity was having major issues, so his feature 
required more work to fix. Brenner managed to rebuild the password reset feature with the help of Leo over Discord, but it took most of Wednesday to get it working with Adrian's new branch. The final build was 
ready and published to Simmer.io by 8 that night, and it was tested and run on our site on two different machines by 10. Peer Testing went well the next day, since we didn't find any major bugs and the build 
worked as expected. We had finalized our Heuristic evaluation document by Wednesday night as well, when we tested the builds. Our other Repo that contains the Unity project itself is below;
(the version we ended up using for peer testing #2 is the branch we linked below, and then the most up to date multiplayer branch is linked after)</p>
