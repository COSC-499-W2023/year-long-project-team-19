OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>While we had some break throughs with some game features (health and resource system, attacking etc.), and the website has 
come along nicely, implementing multiplayer has been quite the process for us. Just getting the right packages set up on everyone's
machines has been abnoxious, and we have had to change packages as well in the process, which just further adds to the headache. Then, 
trying to get the right packages and work uploaded to GitHub so that the other members of the group can use it as well is just as annoying,
so it is taking forever to get it done. We are meeting Tuesday to set up what is going to be tested in class for the milestone, and its not 
the absolute end of the world if the multiplayer isn't somewhat functioning by then, but it would be great if it was.

We still have that other repo open, and the branch that we have linked is the most done version of the card game, and it can be found here:</p>
