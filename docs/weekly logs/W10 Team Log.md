OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>So we have started moving on from exploration, and starting to work on actual features, meaning we opened a ton of new tasks this week. Its also the week before reading week, so we plan 
to do a bit of catch up over the break. We also opened a new "Testing" section of our project board to help keep track of all the individual tests that we want to build for each feature, so we added
the screenshot of it's tasks above following the regular in progress tasks section. We still have the mini presentation demo project in a seperate Github repo found here,</p>

<p>but we are hoping to use the reading week to move everything to this repo, especially since we are admins of the repo now.</p>
