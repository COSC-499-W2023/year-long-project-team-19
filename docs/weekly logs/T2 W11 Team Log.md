OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p> This week we were focused on continuing to get the multiplayer more functional as well as figuring out what needs to be done before the final report is due in two weeks. Henry started setting up tests
for the website using Selenium. Brenner got the play card feature to work over multiplayer, and got the server to handle the turn system as well, so now two clients can actually play a proper game with turns
and playable cards. Only thing left is the health and attack system, so that when one player attacks, the other actually knows it happened and responds accordingly. Should be done this week based on how the 
turn system went. Adrian continued work on implementing different card abilities, as well as ironing out some bugs with the game's UI on the multiplayer branch (card zoom and missing elements). Leo started a
new "game over" scene that will eventually be triggered once the health system works over multiplayer. They also continued working on some of their ideas with the game's UI from last week. Aditya is working on
our tutorial scene for the game, that will be a dummy version of the main game scene, just to get new players aquainted with the game's rules and features.
Our other Repo that contains the Unity project itself is below; (It is the most up to date multiplayer branch)</p>
