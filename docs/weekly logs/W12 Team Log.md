OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>So this week was our last checkpoint before our Design Doc and Design Video milestone is due. We continued to improve the login system, as well as the card game itself and the website. 
We also added the account info and stats system, and continued to build some tests for them. We need to get more tests built however, and the Design doc wants some specific diagrams from our UI, so thats going
to be our focus for the week as well as actually completing the Doc and making our Video. We are now creating a new branch for each feature, and merging them to the development branch and then the development 
branch to master when each milestone is due, to get around the issues we had with merge conflicts in W10 (and the development branch has been rebased). Additionally, we were hoping to upload the Unity project
to this main repo, but we are just uploading the scripts, scenes and assests here instead to track our work better for the TAs, and then still using the other repo when we have to.
