OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>This was the first week of the second semester, so we decided to try to prioritize work on the more important features we have left to implement into our MVP. This meant continuing work on the each card's 
effects and rules, further developing the theme, exploration into setting up multiplayer, and finally, further polishing the design demo versions of the game's features. We decided to work more individually due 
to the nature of the work left. Additionally, there wasn't much to add for testing this week since the card rules aren't implemented into Unity yet, and the multiplayer exploration is separate to our project. 
We still have that other repo open, which is just the design demo milestone version of the game (although the card system might be updated), and it can be found here:</p>
