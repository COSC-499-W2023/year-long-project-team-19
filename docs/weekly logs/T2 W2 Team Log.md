OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>Second week of semester 2 we started to make the game playable and finish up the components needed for the "base" of the game. We're currently figuring out how to turn the game into a multiplayer game now that the base components of the game are done. With all the systems functional we can actually play a very bare bones version of the game where players can draw cards and play them. They can also attack with the cards. The next big step to take is figuring out how we're going to implement the matchmaking between players and mirroring actions. Furthermore, we are also looking into getting the games assets updated to match a predecided aesthetic. We're also looking into putting the colour picking system before the match and adding a win/lose feature in the near future.


We still have that other repo open, which is just the design demo milestone version of the game (although the card system might be updated), and it can be found here:</p>
