OPTIONAL: Any context to explain why the log looks the way it does.
<br><p>We didn't have any assingments/documentation to do this week (apart from the logs), but we all started tutorials as part of our
exploration into Unity, since none of us have used it before. Check the exploration branch to see what we have done so far. It should be
actual programs and the readme might have lists of videos we have watched on it, and interesting notes we have taken.</p>
