## Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

Figuring out the Teck Stack, working on the Project Plan document, setting up Unity on my computer, and completing the weekly logs.


## Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features?

<ol>
  <li>"Figure out the Teck Stack"</li>
  <li>"Project Plan Document"</li>
  <li>"Set up Unity"</li>
  <li>"Team Log"</li>
  <li>"Individual Logs" </li>
</ol>

## Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week?

### Completed: 
  
Me and Adrian finalized our Teck Stack to the best of our abilities, which allowed us to complete the Project Plan Document.
  
### In Progress:

I have Unity running on my system, and I've started working through a tutorial, but since I dont have it interacting with our whole teck stack, I don't count this as completed.
The logs are still in progress, but they will be done as I write this.

#### Aditional Context:

This week was more about finializing our project plan and teck stack, so we didn't do much actual coding. Since we have to learn Unity, we are going to work through some tutorials using each of our packages from our Teck Stack each week, So should we make seperate branches for everyone's progress to show evidence of this work? Let me know.

## Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

Exploration, getting unity working on my other computer and completeing the weekly logs.

<ol>
  <li>"Exploration: Brenner"</li>
  <li>"Set up Unity"</li>

## Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week?

### Completed: 
  
I got a version of Unity working on my Laptop, so I could work on tutorials from anywhere. Last week I just got it running on my PC at home.
  
### In Progress:

I started working through some tutorials and watching videos on Unity, its not completed though, and technically won't ever be.
The logs are still in progress, but they will be done as I write this.

#### Aditional Context:

This week was about exploring Unity, so we didn't do much else. Check the Exploration Branch for our work.

<ol>
  <li>"Exploration: Brenner"</li>
  <li>"Set up Unity"</li>
  <li>"W6 Team Log"</li>

</ol>

## Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week?

### Completed: 
<ol>
  <li>"W6 Team Log"</li>
</ol>
  
### In Progress:
<ol>
  <li>"Exploration: I followed a tutorial to build a main menu that can actually launch and quit the game, but I plan to do more next week, hopefully having a menu that will resemble the one we will actually use for our project."</li>
  <li>"I Set up Unity on both of my computers, BUT we want to set up GitHub to work with our project as well, so its still in progress."</li>
  <li>"W6 Individual Logs: I'm finishing this as I write this out."</li>
</ol>

#### Aditional Context:

So we didn't have any asignments this week apart from the logs, and we all need to learn Unity, so our main focus this week (and probably next week) is to get our hands dirty with some more tutorials. The goal is to do tutorials that are more related to what we actually need for our presentation in 3 weeks. I aimed for main menu and UI design, while other members aimed at designing actual card objects that the game will use, and others on running our unity game in a web browser. I made a video and then GIF of the UI I built in action, which you can find on my Exploration's Readme. Also, I have Unity set up on both of my computers now, but we want to get GitHub working with it, so that the whole group will be able to work on the same project for our presentation. Thats the goal for next week. ***Also, this week and next week's peer evaluations got merged into one, so they will share the same screenshot.

#### Aditional Context:

So we still didn't have any asignments or class this week apart from the logs, so our main focus this week was to do some more tutorials and get GitHub working with our Unity projects. The goal was to do tutorials that are more related to what we actually need for our presentation in 2 weeks. I continued my work into UI design by improving on the Menu I built last week, and I set up a new repository that my group can upload our Unity projects to in order to share each others work. I also made a new video and then GIF of this UI in action, which you can find on my Exploration's Readme. We plan to use the main "year-long-project" repo for our actual project, but for the exploration projects, the new one is fine. Here is the link:
