## Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features?

<ol>
  <li>"Figure out the Teck Stack"</li>
  <li>"Project Plan Document"</li>
  <li>"Set up Unity"</li>
  <li>"Team Log"</li>
  <li>"Individual Logs" </li>
</ol>

## Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week?

### Completed: 
  
Me and Adrian finalized our Teck Stack to the best of our abilities, which allowed us to complete the Project Plan Document.
  
### In Progress:

I have Unity running on my system, and I've started working through a tutorial, but since I dont have it interacting with our whole teck stack, I don't count this as completed.
The logs are still in progress, but they will be done as I write this.

#### Aditional Context:

This week was more about finializing our project plan and teck stack, so we didn't do much actual coding. Since we have to learn Unity, we are going to work through some tutorials using each of our packages from our Teck Stack each week, So should we make seperate branches for everyone's progress to show evidence of this work? Let me know.
