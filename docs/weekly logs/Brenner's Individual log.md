## Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

Figuring out the Teck Stack, working on the Project Plan document, setting up Unity on my computer, and completing the weekly logs.

## Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features?

<ol>
  <li>"Figure out the Teck Stack"</li>
  <li>"Project Plan Document"</li>
  <li>"Set up Unity"</li>
  <li>"Team Log"</li>
  <li>"Individual Logs" </li>
</ol>

## Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week?

### Completed:

Me and Adrian finalized our Teck Stack to the best of our abilities, which allowed us to complete the Project Plan Document.

### In Progress:

I have Unity running on my system, and I've started working through a tutorial, but since I dont have it interacting with our whole teck stack, I don't count this as completed.
The logs are still in progress, but they will be done as I write this.

#### Aditional Context:

This week was more about finializing our project plan and teck stack, so we didn't do much actual coding. Since we have to learn Unity, we are going to work through some tutorials using each of our packages from our Teck Stack each week, So should we make seperate branches for everyone's progress to show evidence of this work? Let me know.

## Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week?

### Completed:

I got a version of Unity working on my Laptop, so I could work on tutorials from anywhere. Last week I just got it running on my PC at home.

### In Progress:

I started working through some tutorials and watching videos on Unity, its not completed though, and technically won't ever be.
The logs are still in progress, but they will be done as I write this.

#### Aditional Context:

This week was about exploring Unity, so we didn't do much else. Check the Exploration Branch for our work.

  <li>"Exploration: I followed a tutorial to build a main menu that can actually launch and quit the game, but I plan to do more next week, hopefully having a menu that will resemble the one we will actually use for our project."</li>

  <li>"W6 Individual Logs: I'm finishing this as I write this out."</li>
</ol>

#### Aditional Context:

So we didn't have any asignments this week apart from the logs, and we all need to learn Unity, so our main focus this week (and probably next week) is to get our hands dirty with some more tutorials. The goal is to do tutorials that are more related to what we actually need for our presentation in 3 weeks. I aimed for main menu and UI design, while other members aimed at designing actual card objects that the game will use, and others on running our unity game in a web browser. I made a video and then GIF of the UI I built in action, which you can find on my Exploration's Readme. Also, I have Unity set up on both of my computers now, but we want to get GitHub working with it, so that the whole group will be able to work on the same project for our presentation. Thats the goal for next week. \*\*\*Also, this week and next week's peer evaluations got merged into one, so they will share the same screenshot.

So we still didn't have any asignments or class this week apart from the logs, so our main focus this week was to do some more tutorials and get GitHub working with our Unity projects. The goal was to do tutorials that are more related to what we actually need for our presentation in 2 weeks. I continued my work into UI design by improving on the Menu I built last week, and I set up a new repository that my group can upload our Unity projects to in order to share each others work. I also made a new video and then GIF of this UI in action, which you can find on my Exploration's Readme. We plan to use the main "year-long-project" repo for our actual project, but for the exploration projects, the new one is fine. Here is the link:

Henry showed me and Adrian how to publish our Unity project as a WebGL package, but he was the one who built the website for our actual demo. I just helped with the choices he made (if we wanted to make a complete site ourselves or upload to another website, and what pages to include (the cards and rules page).

  <li>"Login System Draft: I have it currently set up to take a username and password, and check if the username exists in the database, and then if the password matches the username. Not a lot of tests yet, and I just hard coded an account into the database to check for now."</li>

#### Aditional Context:

Since we started focussing on actual features instead of more exploration, there is a ton of new tasks opened and things to do, but I feel like I made solid progress into the login system for this week. Getting a local server running was a bit tricky since I'm a bit out of practice, and the week was very busy for me. We are planning to take advantage of the week off for reading break to really flush out some of the features further. I want to add lots of tests for my login system and maybe a password encryptor for when Unity checks the user's entered data with the php file. Also we still have that other repo open for the main game project found here:

#### Aditional Context:

So this week was reading week, and I didn't end up making much commits to our branches during it, but I did actually write up the code and stuff during the week for the login and create account system on my other computer, I just didn't get around to uploading it to Github properly till W12. Also, we came up with a solution to show the commits to the game project on the main repo now, instead of only the other additional repo we were using before. Now for every feature we are working on, we are making a new branch, and then merging it to "development" and then from there to "master" when each milestone is due, and the game scripts and scenes are being uploaded to these branches as well now (before they were mostly on the other repo and they weren't always getting seen). Now we just need to figure out the conflict issues with the development branch (the merge issues were still busted as of W11). 
We still have that other repo open, just because its a way better way to collaborate on a Unity Project (You don't have to manually set up the scripts and scenes everytime theres a change), which is found here:

### In Progress:
<ol>
  <li>"Login System Draft: It now returns the user's information to a script that I can use to set up the Account info page as well as the user stats page. I also updated the UI a bit so that the user can't see their password as they type (its replaced by stars), and added a "tabBetween.cs" script so that users can now tab between the input fields. Still need to add a log out button, and for some reason the code I have written to take the user back to the main menu upon successfully isn't yet working right. Also looking at preventing SQL injection."</li>
  <li>"Create Account System Draft: I altered the database to store user info like the date it was created or the number of games they've played etc. They default to 0 and whatever date it was when the account is created upon the user successfully creating a new account. The php also sends said information to the same script that I will use to send the Account and stats page the user's stats. The same UI changes for the login apply here (hidden password and tab between script). The code to take the user back to the main menu upon successfully logging in is suppoed to work here as well, but its still not working yet."</li>
  <li>"Account Stats System: Now that the login and create account systems return a logged in user's information ("readInput.cs" takes info and sends it to new "DBMnager.cs" script), I was able to change the account info menu and stats menu to actually display the logged in user's information properly which is cool. Currently there is no system to actually change the values (because the card game isn't yet playable, but it should be easy enough to add as the game gets further developed."</li>
  <li>"Exploration: I'm still learning stuff, for example this week I learned how to get my php files to send its query contents to a Unity script and have Unity actually do things with that info. "</li>
  <li>"W12 Individual Logs: I'm finishing this as I write this out."</li>
</ol>

#### Aditional Context:

I uploaded my commits of the php files and new scripts on the "userAccountSystem" branch I created for the login, create and account info systems. Check the "app/sqlconnect" folder for php files, and the     "gameScripts" and "gameScripts/UI" for the Mainmenu.cs, ReadInput.cs, DBManager.cs, and tabBetween.cs files.

So this week is the last checkpoint before our design video and design document milestone is due, so I was focussing on flsuhing out enough features to meet our milestone requirements we set up for ourselves in the project plan back in October. I still need to work on the UI design for that milestone (the doc wants diagrams and stuff), but I'm pretty happy with where these features are now other than that. I am a litle worried about the tests for the account system overall, since I haven't written any automated tests yet, but we have a week to get some of these things done at least. Me and Henry ended up just "Rebasing" the development branch in order to solve the conflict issues, since there was nothing on the development branch that needed to be saved, and we hadn't really been pushing to it oftern till that point, and now it seems fixed. The plan is to use a new and different branch for each feature, and then push them all to development for each milestone, and then just do the one merge to master, so we will find out if it worked without issues by tonight.

### In Progress:
<ol>
  <li>"Login format testing: I wrote "loginTests.cs", which is a Unity editMode test script that tests 7 different combos of valid and invalid usernames and passwords on the "readInput.cs" script that 
  my login system uses to log in to accounts using the login.php file. I made it before I finished the createTests.cs script, which is way more extensive than only 7 tests, so it should be relatively easy to implement similar tests from the createTests into this script and I think necessary. Doesn't test if username or password is long enough because the login.php is behind the create.php.</li>
  <li>"Create user Testing: I wrote "createTests.cs", which is a Unity editMode test script that tests different combos of 4 different usernames and 6 different combinations of 2 passwords on the "readInput.cs" script that my create account system uses to create and log in to accounts using the create.php file. I need to add support for one more variation of username and clean up the readablilty og the code (its 650+ lines of code long, but could probably be condensed to around 2-300 if I used method calls for similar password combos.</li>
  <li>"Design Documentation (November Milestone): Still filling it out, but its almost done."</li>
  <li>"Design Video (November Milestone): Just need to put each member's videos together."</li>
  <li>"Login System Draft: Its still a work in progress, and I changed a bit of its look when I redesigned the UI of the main menus. I added the logout function and it display the proper menus perfectly, but for some reason the code I have written to take the user back to the main menu upon successfully still isn't working right. Oh and I have't yet set up the ability to press enter and login, or to clear the input fields whenever the user leaves the page. Also added some logic to the login.php to help prevent SQL injection."</li>
  <li>"Create Account System Draft: Its still a work in progress, and I changed a bit of its look when I redesigned the UI of the main menus. I also added some more error codes in the create.php that check the username and password's length now. The code to take the user back to the main menu upon successfully logging in is supposed to work here as well, but its still not working yet."</li>

#### Aditional Context:

I uploaded my commits of the php files and new scripts on the "userAccountSystem" branch I created for the login, create and account info systems. Check the "app/sqlconnect" folder for php files, and the     "gameScripts" and "gameScripts/UI" for the Mainmenu.cs, ReadInput.cs, DBManager.cs, and tabBetween.cs files.

So this week our design video and design document milestone is due, so I was focussing on flushing out my useraccount system and implementing unit tests since Leo never got around to it in time, and I was also focused on our Design Doc and Video. I ended up resdesigning the theme of the main menu as well after we came up with a title and some ideas for the game's theming which was cool. 
We still have that other repo open, just because its a way better way to collaborate on a Unity Project (You don't have to manually set up the scripts and scenes everytime theres a change), but I made a new branch to show off the new theming and figure out some things. It can be found here:

This was the first week of the second semester, so we decided to try to prioritize work on the more important features we have left to implement into our MVP. For me this meant getting to work on understanding how we can begin to implement some form of matchmaking into our current game. Since none of us have used Unity before this class, and we haven't begun to set up hosting or servers for actually playing against an opponent yet, we needed to start with exploration into it as soon as possible. I ended up following along with this tutorial on youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stJ4SESQwJQ". While it doesn't translate perfectly to our game, it should prove to be instrumental in our implementation of networking into our game further down the line. It demonstrates examples of how to run two different games to test simultaneously, how to have two different games display the same objects, how to run each game as a client, host, or a server (and how each of these have different authority over who can change certain objects). Our game is technically going to look different for each player (each player should be able to see their opponenet's cards for example), but they will need to mirror certain cards/effects being played. I made a GIF below that shows what I mean.

Since I mostly worked on exploration this week, I didn't change much on either repo. 
We still have another repo open from the design demo at the end of the first semester, and you can find it here:

## Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

Trying to figure out multiplayer (how to set up a server, do we want dedicated servers, how does that work with unity, etc.), and completing the weekly logs. 

## Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features?

<ol>
  <li>"matchmaking draft"</li>
  <li>"Exploration: Brenner"</li>
  <li>"T2 W2 Team Log"</li>
  <li>"T2 W2 Individual Logs"</li>
  <li>"Finish Card Game Rules"</li>
</ol>

## Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last week?

### Completed:

<ol>
  <li>"T2 W2 Team Log"</li>
</ol>
  
### In Progress:
<ol>
  <li>"Exploration: Brenner: I watched hours of different tutorials trying to figure out how best to implement a server for our game, but honeslty didn't yield great results. I think a server will have to host a individual "server build" of our game for every 2 players wishing to play, but I can't quite figure out the logistics of that yet. Every video just glosses over how the server actually works or tells you to read the documentation which is not helpful for me. We are going to talk to the professor and TA about it in our next meeting. For the forst peer testing milestone, we are just going to have each machine run both games on a local server simultaneously (which is fundamentally the same coding wise, apart from needing to do all the server infrastructure backend)."</li>
  <li>"matchmaking draft: I am going to be following along with a new tutorial to convert our game's card objects into network objects that netcode can use to display different things between the client and server sides of our game this week. The link to the playlist of videos can be found here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCbP9KGntfcFTL19eDZsWSkVMfXANF7-U&si=I_NVzdA6X_DBcT4V"</li>
  <li>"T2 W2 Individual Logs: I'm finishing this as I write this out."</li>
  <li>"Finish Card Game Rules: We still need to play test the crap out of the cards before we can say we are finished with them."</li>
</ol>

#### Aditional Context:

So as the peer testing #1 milestone looms closer, I really tried to get into how to set up the back end infastructure of a multiplayer system for our game. Problem is, I've never done anything quite like it before, and despite watching at least 8 hours of different tutorials and videos this week, I still don't know exactly what to do. Most videos/guides completely gloss over how exactly to set up a server and just focus on how to develop the game with the client and sever in mind, which is helpful for what we are going to be doing, but not at actually telling me what I am looking for. I think for the first deliverable, it should be fine to just run 2 builds locally having one act as a host and the other a client, since that should still illustrate exactly how the game will work in the field if we actually deploy dedicated servers, while cutting out actually setting up a game server, since that feels honeslty like its outside the scope of the course. We are going to talk to the TA and the professor about it next class though. This week I'm going to shift my focus to turning our current game's objects and system into a new version that will work with the client and server builds of the game following along to this playlist's videos (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCbP9KGntfcFTL19eDZsWSkVMfXANF7-U&si=I_NVzdA6X_DBcT4V), so that we will have the two different versions of the game ot test for the milestone date.
