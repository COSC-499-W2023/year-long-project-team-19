We had a meeting from 2 P.M. to 3:30 P.M. in which we discussed the project plan and the division of the tasks for our year-long project. It was attended by all the members except Leo in the group as he was busy with personal work. 
We planned out the important milestones of the project in this meeting and discussed some extra features which could be added.

We did a second meeting at 7 P.M. which was attended by all the members and we finalised all the extra features we will add. We ran through the division chart of tasks again with the whole team to finalize everyone's role in the project.
We finsihed the project plan document in this second meeting and finished our individual and team logs respectively.
