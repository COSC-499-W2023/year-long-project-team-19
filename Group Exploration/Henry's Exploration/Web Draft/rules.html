        <h2>Pre-game Preparation and Determination of Turn Order</h2>
        <p>
          Before the game begins there are <strong>4</strong> decks players can choose from. These decks have their own identities and play differently from one another.
          More information about their identities and unique interactions can be found in the Deck Identity section of this document.
          One player will be chosen randomly to choose one of the four decks they would like to include in this round of the game.
          After that player chooses a deck to include, the other person chooses the next deck to include.
          Then both cards are shuffled into one deck.
        </p>

        <h2>Start of game</h2>
        <p>
          After choosing decks, the game starts. 
          Each player draws 7 cards at the start of the game. 
          They can choose to redraw or keep their current hand (this is often called a mulligan in card games). 
          After both players are done with their mulligan the game officially begins.
          <br/>
          Each player begins with 30 health. The goal of the game is to get your opponent to 0 health

        <h2>Turn Advantage and Balancing</h2>
        <p>
          Turn wise, the person who chose a deck and color identity <strong>SECOND</strong> goes <strong>FIRST</strong>. 
          This is for balancing purposes. 
          The ability to choose your preferred color identity and deck is a considerable enough advantage to warrant first turns being handed to the other player.

        <h2>Alternate win condition</h2>
        <p>
          In the case that players want to win by strategies other than dealing damage, players can also <strong>lose the game if they have to draw from an empty deck.</strong>
          This is colloquially known as a mill strategy. 
          Some cards may also provide winning strategies, fulfilling these conditions allows you to win the game as well.
