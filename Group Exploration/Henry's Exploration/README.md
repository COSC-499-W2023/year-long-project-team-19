## 7 October - Only assets folder is uploaded due to extremly large amount of files in the entire set.

# Week 9 (Oct. 29th to Nov. 5th):
This week, I focused on finalizing the website that incorporates WebGL. I utilized standard HTML for website creation and employed CSS for effective styling, ensuring a polished and professional appearance.

A notable aspect of the project involved dedicating time to perfecting the Card UI for the Card documentation section. Crafting an intuitive and visually appealing user interface required attention to detail and design elements.

Moreover, I have successfully deployed the website to Vercel. This eliminates the need for local hosting, providing a more convenient and efficient means of accessing and showcasing the project. 

(I use my private personal repo to deploy it)
