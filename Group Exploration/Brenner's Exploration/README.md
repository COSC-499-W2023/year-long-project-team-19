So for Week 6, (Oct 1st to Oct 8th), I spent about 4 hours trying to get the most up to date version of Unity running on my laptop. This reason it took so long, is because my laptop is quite old, and a mac, so trying to find software that is still supported on it can be quite the headache. Plus, each download attempt took a couple hours since my wifi was having issues. 

I ended up finally getting 2020.3.38f1 downloaded and installed properly. I then ran through the "Get started with the Unity Hub" Tutorial from Unity Learn. https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-started-with-the-unity-hub-1?uv=2019.4
Check my folder for the "Essentials 3D project" it asked to create.

I also started the 2D game development tutorial project and did the first 2 tutorials inside of it. (I was able to play the game in the play menu (which ran suprisingly smooth), change my player's speed, and in the second tutorial, I learned how to move the game's objects around (like the gems for example.)). Check my folder for "firstpractice".
