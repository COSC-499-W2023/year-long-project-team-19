# So for Week 6 (Oct 1st to Oct 8th):
I spent about 4 hours trying to get the most up to date version of Unity running on my laptop. This reason it took so long, is because my laptop is quite old, and a mac, so trying to find software that is still supported on it can be quite the headache. Plus, each download attempt took a couple hours since my wifi was having issues. 

I ended up finally getting 2020.3.38f1 downloaded and installed properly. I then ran through the "Get started with the Unity Hub" Tutorial from Unity Learn. https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-started-with-the-unity-hub-1?uv=2019.4
#### Check my folder for the "Essentials 3D project" it asked to create.

I also started the 2D game development tutorial project and did the first 2 tutorials inside of it. (I was able to play the game in the play menu (which ran suprisingly smooth), change my player's speed, and in the second tutorial, I learned how to move the game's objects around (like the gems for example.)).

# Week 7 (Oct. 8th to 15th): 
I wanted to get into some tutorials that are more on topic towards our mini presentation requirements, and Adrian is alread doing some of the card gameplay, so I wanted to do some on the user interface. 

I spent a bit of time hand crafting a moc up of a main menu in photoshop, using some publilcy avaliable assests (just the grey button png in this case), and then followed this tutorial to a tee more or less: 
#### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsgiYqLID-U. 
Now I have a main menu scene in unity with clickable buttons, as well as the ability to launch the 2D platformer tutorial from said main menu's start button. I even added some animations of the buttons, so that they change their look when they are hovered over. In order to launch the 2D platformer tutorial with the buttons, I had to do a small amount of scripting in order to get the game scene to change, which will be quite useful for the rest of the project.

#### I made a GIF of the menu in action: 
<img src= "img_resources/unityUITutorialGIF1.gif">

Note: Because I'm just running the game inside the Unity Editor, the Quit Button doesn't actually close the game, so I zoomed into the debug message to show that it works as intended.
